Description: Some wrappers to run structure from the parameter sets created by the
  Java Structure Front End, and then extract some results and things.  This is
  just a little thing I whacked together because I was distraught that there was
  no way to recover the traces different values from the Java front end (except by
  plotting them in the front end.)
